# Introduction
ROS (Robot Operating System) is an open-source platform widely used in Robotics. For developers and researchers, ROS provides plenty of open-source tools and packages. <br>
If you want to know about Robotics, which is an interesting researching area in Compute Science, you might want to get familiar with ROS first. It could provides Robot simulation, open-source algorithm demos and easily implementation of you ideas with open-source tools. 

# Pre-request
Before you start working on this project, you should:
- Be familiar with at least one programming language. (Unfortunately, currently ROS only support Python2/C++). 
- Know the basic concepts of ROS system, including:
	+ Topic

# FAQ
- Q: I'm not sure whether I meet the programming pre-requests. <br>
A: Refer to other questions first. You should pass the median level of the programming first.
- Q: How to get basic concepts of ROS?<br>
A: Refer to ROS official tutorial, beginner level tutorial should be sufficient enough. The tutorial is available [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials).
